`Stack-mode` hopes to be a full featured Stack Exchange mode for
GNU Emacs 24 and up. Using version 2.2, and subsequent versions as available, of
the Stack Exchange API we aim to create a more versatile experience of Stack Exchange inside of Emacs.

This README will eventually hold a high-level feature list and details
on installation and configuration.

## Icons<a id="sec-2-1" name="sec-2-1"></a>

Stack Exchange Mode for Emacs has no explicit use for an icon,
although standard SVG files have been gathered in `resources/` if
anyone would fancy a crack at it.
