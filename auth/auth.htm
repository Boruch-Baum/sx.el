    <p>The StackExchange team doesn't like automated scripts (bots)
    which affect the content of the websites. Of course we, Emacs
    users, are all about optimisation. And that's great! It's
    perfectly OK to optimize your interactions, as long as you're
    still interacting.
      <ul>
        <li>It's OK to define commands or abbrevs for comments you post very often.</li>
        <li>It's OK to write a bot that gathers a list of questions you might like.</li>
        <li>It's <strong>not</strong> OK to write a bot that down-votes questions or posts comments based on some criteria.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Remember, the StackExchange API is a privilege, let's use it
    for good. Anything that potentially decreases the quality of
    content is off-grounds.</p> <hr/>
